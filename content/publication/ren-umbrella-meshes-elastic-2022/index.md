abstract: We present a computational inverse design framework for a new class of volumetric
  deployable structures that have compact rest states and deploy into bending-active
  3D target surfaces.               Umbrella meshes               consist of elastic
  beams, rigid plates, and hinge joints that can be directly printed or assembled
  in a zero-energy fabrication state. During deployment, as the elastic beams of varying
  heights rotate from vertical to horizontal configurations, the entire structure
  transforms from a compact block into a target curved surface. Umbrella Meshes encode
  both intrinsic and extrinsic curvature of the target surface and in principle are
  free from the area expansion ratio bounds of past auxetic material systems.                          We
  build a reduced physics-based simulation framework to accurately and efficiently
  model the complex interaction between the elastically deforming components. To determine
  the mesh topology and optimal shape parameters for approximating a given target
  surface, we propose an inverse design optimization algorithm initialized with conformal
  flattening. Our algorithm minimizes the structure's strain energy in its deployed
  state and optimizes actuation forces so that the final deployed structure is in
  stable equilibrium close to the desired surface with few or no external constraints.
  We validate our approach by fabricating a series of physical models at various scales
  using different manufacturing techniques.
