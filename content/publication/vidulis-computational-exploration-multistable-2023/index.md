abstract: We present an algorithmic approach to discover, study, and design multistable
  elastic knots. Elastic knots are physical realizations of closed curves embedded
  in 3-space. When endowed with the material thickness and bending resistance of a
  physical wire, these knots settle into equilibrium states that balance the forces
  induced by elastic deformation and self-contacts of the wire. In general, elastic
  knots can have many distinct equilibrium states, i.e. they are               multistable               mechanical
  systems. We propose a computational pipeline that combines randomized spatial sampling
  and physics simulation to efficiently find stable equilibrium states of elastic
  knots. Leveraging results from knot theory, we run our pipeline on thousands of
  different topological knot types to create an extensive data set of multistable
  knots. By applying a series of filters to this data, we discover new transformable
  knots with interesting geometric and physical properties. A further analysis across
  knot types reveals geometric and topological patterns, yielding constructive principles
  that generalize beyond the currently tabulated knot types. We show how multistable
  elastic knots can be used to design novel deployable structures and engaging recreational
  puzzles. Several physical prototypes at different scales highlight these applications
  and validate our simulation.
