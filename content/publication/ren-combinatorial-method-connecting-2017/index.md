abstract: The phylogenetic tree space introduced by Billera, Holmes, and Vogtmann
  (BHV tree space) is a CAT(0) continuous space that represents trees with edge weights
  with an intrinsic geodesic distance measure. The geodesic distance measure unique
  to BHV tree space is well known to be computable in polynomial time, which makes
  it a potentially powerful tool for optimization problems in phylogenetics and phylogenomics.
  Specifically, there is significant interest in comparing and combining phylogenetic
  trees. For example, BHV tree space has been shown to be potentially useful in tree
  summary and consensus methods, which require combining trees with different number
  of leaves. Yet an open problem is to transition between BHV tree spaces of different
  maximal dimension, where each maximal dimension corresponds to the complete set
  of edge-weighted trees with a fixed number of leaves. We show a combinatorial method
  to transition between copies of BHV tree spaces in which trees with different numbers
  of taxa can be studied, derived from its topological structure and geometric properties.
  This method removes obstacles for embedding problems such as supertree and consensus
  methods in the BHV treespace framework.
