abstract: 'Abstract             Elastic surfaces that morph between multiple geometrical
  configurations are of significant engineering value, with applications ranging from
  the deployment of space-based photovoltaic arrays, the erection of temporary shelters,
  and the realization of flexible display systems, to understanding the encapsulation
  and release of viral RNAs. In general, ensuring that a shape with a planar rest
  configuration can deploy into a target three-dimensional (3D) shape is a nontrivial
  problem. Moreover, it is difficult to physically realize the local deformations
  necessary to achieve such global transformation. Here, we give a tutorial on applying
  conformal mapping to rationalize the geometrical deformation of several microstructure
  designs. A conformal map is a function that locally preserves angles and shapes
  but not lengths: some regions are scaled (enlarged or shrunk) more than others.
  To transform a planar surface to 3D, we implement uniform local scalings as mechanical
  deformations. Numerous natural and architected material systems exhibit such behavior,
  including kirigami, origami, hydrogel, linkage mechanisms, and fabric membranes.
  The design and fabrication of conformally transformable surfaces is a transdisciplinary
  challenge involving insights from advanced manufacturing, computational design,
  material science, and mechanics. By recognizing that many material systems exhibit
  isotropic deformation, we hope to inspire researchers to adopt conformal mapping
  in designing next-generation surface-based engineering systems.'
