abstract: (c) (d) (e) (f) Fig. 1. Our inverse design optimization algorithm takes
  as input a target design surface (a) and a weaving topology graph (b), and calculates
  the planar freeform ribbon shapes (e) so that the simulated equilibrium weave (c)
  and final physical prototype (d) best approximate the target surface. Several fabricated
  models illustrate how our method allows weaving a variety of double-curved surfaces
  from planar curved ribbons (f). Basket weaving is a traditional craft for creating
  curved surfaces as an interwoven array of thin, flexible, and initially straight
  ribbons. The three-dimensional shape of a woven structure emerges through a complex
  interplay of the elastic bending behavior of the ribbons and the contact forces
  at their crossings. Curvature can be injected by carefully placing topological singu-larities
  in the otherwise regular weaving pattern. However, shape control through topology
  is highly non-trivial and inherently discrete, which severely limits the range of
  attainable woven geometries. Here, we demonstrate how to construct arbitrary smooth
  free-form surface geometries by weaving carefully optimized curved ribbons. We present
  an optimization-based approach to solving the inverse design problem for such woven
  structures. Our algorithm computes the ribbons' planar geometry such that their
  in-terwoven assembly closely approximates a given target design surface in equilibrium.
  We systematically validate our approach through a series of physical prototypes
  to show a broad range of new woven geometries that is not achievable by existing
  methods. We anticipate our computational approach to significantly enhance the capabilities
  for the design of new woven structures. Facilitated by modern digital fabrication
  technology, we see potential applications in material science, bio-and mechanical
  engineering, art, design, and architecture.
