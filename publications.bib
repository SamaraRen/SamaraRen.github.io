  abstract = {Inspired by motion patterns of some commercially available mobile robots, we investigate the power of robots that move forward in straight lines until colliding with an environment boundary, at which point they can rotate in place and move forward again; we visualize this as the robot ‘‘bouncing’’ off boundaries. We define bounce rules governing how the robot should reorient after reaching a boundary, such as reorienting relative to its heading prior to collision, or relative to the normal of the boundary. We then generate plans as sequences of rules, using the bounce visibility graph generated from a polygonal environment definition, while assuming we have unavoidable non-determinism in our actuation. Our planner can be queried to determine the feasibility of tasks such as reaching goal sets and patrolling (repeatedly visiting a sequence of goals). If the task is found feasible, the planner provides a sequence of non-deterministic interaction rules, which also provide information on how precisely the robot must execute the plan to succeed. We also show how to compute stable cyclic trajectories and use these to limit uncertainty in the robot’s position.},

  abstract = {(c) (d) (e) (f) Fig. 1. Our inverse design optimization algorithm takes as input a target design surface (a) and a weaving topology graph (b), and calculates the planar freeform ribbon shapes (e) so that the simulated equilibrium weave (c) and final physical prototype (d) best approximate the target surface. Several fabricated models illustrate how our method allows weaving a variety of double-curved surfaces from planar curved ribbons (f). Basket weaving is a traditional craft for creating curved surfaces as an interwoven array of thin, flexible, and initially straight ribbons. The three-dimensional shape of a woven structure emerges through a complex interplay of the elastic bending behavior of the ribbons and the contact forces at their crossings. Curvature can be injected by carefully placing topological singu-larities in the otherwise regular weaving pattern. However, shape control through topology is highly non-trivial and inherently discrete, which severely limits the range of attainable woven geometries. Here, we demonstrate how to construct arbitrary smooth free-form surface geometries by weaving carefully optimized curved ribbons. We present an optimization-based approach to solving the inverse design problem for such woven structures. Our algorithm computes the ribbons' planar geometry such that their in-terwoven assembly closely approximates a given target design surface in equilibrium. We systematically validate our approach through a series of physical prototypes to show a broad range of new woven geometries that is not achievable by existing methods. We anticipate our computational approach to significantly enhance the capabilities for the design of new woven structures. Facilitated by modern digital fabrication technology, we see potential applications in material science, bio-and mechanical engineering, art, design, and architecture.},

  abstract = {The phylogenetic tree space introduced by Billera, Holmes, and Vogtmann (BHV tree space) is a CAT(0) continuous space that represents trees with edge weights with an intrinsic geodesic distance measure. The geodesic distance measure unique to BHV tree space is well known to be computable in polynomial time, which makes it a potentially powerful tool for optimization problems in phylogenetics and phylogenomics. Specifically, there is significant interest in comparing and combining phylogenetic trees. For example, BHV tree space has been shown to be potentially useful in tree summary and consensus methods, which require combining trees with different number of leaves. Yet an open problem is to transition between BHV tree spaces of different maximal dimension, where each maximal dimension corresponds to the complete set of edge-weighted trees with a fixed number of leaves. We show a combinatorial method to transition between copies of BHV tree spaces in which trees with different numbers of taxa can be studied, derived from its topological structure and geometric properties. This method removes obstacles for embedding problems such as supertree and consensus methods in the BHV treespace framework.},

  abstract = {We present a computational inverse design framework for a new class of volumetric deployable structures that have compact rest states and deploy into bending-active 3D target surfaces.               Umbrella meshes               consist of elastic beams, rigid plates, and hinge joints that can be directly printed or assembled in a zero-energy fabrication state. During deployment, as the elastic beams of varying heights rotate from vertical to horizontal configurations, the entire structure transforms from a compact block into a target curved surface. Umbrella Meshes encode both intrinsic and extrinsic curvature of the target surface and in principle are free from the area expansion ratio bounds of past auxetic material systems.                          We build a reduced physics-based simulation framework to accurately and efficiently model the complex interaction between the elastically deforming components. To determine the mesh topology and optimal shape parameters for approximating a given target surface, we propose an inverse design optimization algorithm initialized with conformal flattening. Our algorithm minimizes the structure's strain energy in its deployed state and optimizes actuation forces so that the final deployed structure is in stable equilibrium close to the desired surface with few or no external constraints. We validate our approach by fabricating a series of physical models at various scales using different manufacturing techniques.},

  abstract = {We present an algorithmic approach to discover, study, and design multistable elastic knots. Elastic knots are physical realizations of closed curves embedded in 3-space. When endowed with the material thickness and bending resistance of a physical wire, these knots settle into equilibrium states that balance the forces induced by elastic deformation and self-contacts of the wire. In general, elastic knots can have many distinct equilibrium states, i.e. they are               multistable               mechanical systems. We propose a computational pipeline that combines randomized spatial sampling and physics simulation to efficiently find stable equilibrium states of elastic knots. Leveraging results from knot theory, we run our pipeline on thousands of different topological knot types to create an extensive data set of multistable knots. By applying a series of filters to this data, we discover new transformable knots with interesting geometric and physical properties. A further analysis across knot types reveals geometric and topological patterns, yielding constructive principles that generalize beyond the currently tabulated knot types. We show how multistable elastic knots can be used to design novel deployable structures and engaging recreational puzzles. Several physical prototypes at different scales highlight these applications and validate our simulation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Elastic surfaces that morph between multiple geometrical configurations are of significant engineering value, with applications ranging from the deployment of space-based photovoltaic arrays, the erection of temporary shelters, and the realization of flexible display systems, to understanding the encapsulation and release of viral RNAs. In general, ensuring that a shape with a planar rest configuration can deploy into a target three-dimensional (3D) shape is a nontrivial problem. Moreover, it is difficult to physically realize the local deformations necessary to achieve such global transformation. Here, we give a tutorial on applying conformal mapping to rationalize the geometrical deformation of several microstructure designs. A conformal map is a function that locally preserves angles and shapes but not lengths: some regions are scaled (enlarged or shrunk) more than others. To transform a planar surface to 3D, we implement uniform local scalings as mechanical deformations. Numerous natural and architected material systems exhibit such behavior, including kirigami, origami, hydrogel, linkage mechanisms, and fabric membranes. The design and fabrication of conformally transformable surfaces is a transdisciplinary challenge involving insights from advanced manufacturing, computational design, material science, and mechanics. By recognizing that many material systems exhibit isotropic deformation, we hope to inspire researchers to adopt conformal mapping in designing next-generation surface-based engineering systems.},
